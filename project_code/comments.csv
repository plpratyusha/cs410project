I’m wondering if the coffee be left out of this recipe? Can it be completely left out or substituted?
"Hi Angela, the espresso powder is what gives them their mocha flavor, but you can certainly leave it out if you just want a chocolate and peppermint cookie!"
I’m not much of a peppermint person but love using peppermint as decoration on desserts for the holidays. I didn’t use the peppermint extract and just used more vanilla instead. They were so delicious! These cookies were so beautiful in the cookie boxes I gave out as gifts! <3

"BEST COOKIES! My family and I are completely obsessed. SO many compliments at Christmas. The softest, best tasting cookies ever…like thin mint flavor, but soooo soft and chewy..omg, don’t miss giving this a try. I’m about to make them again without peppermint extract, and using PB chips to make a choc PB variation!"

"Another perfect cookie recipe that is above all expectations. It is a great combination of mocha, chocolate and peppermint all rolled into one. You can’t stop with just one cookie. This recipe is a treasure and I can’t thank Sally enough for sharing it."
