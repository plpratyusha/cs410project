"I‚Äôll be baking this over and over again, I can tell!",5
These are unbelievable! A lot easier than making a pie and they‚Äôre not overly sweet. Made no changes!,5
OMG ‚Äì I made this for Thanksgiving as my husband LOVES cherry pie. I am not a huge cherry pie person. I couldn‚Äôt find the sour cherries so I used the sweet frozen and followed the directions for that. I LOVE this recipe. I keep going back for just a little bite! LOL I will definitely be making this again.,5
"Could you used another fruit such pears for this recipe instead of cherries? The pears would baked before hand, sliced, and layered a top the crust.",
"Hi Carson, you could use pears for this. I wouldn‚Äôt pre-cook them though. You may be better off following the recipe for these apple pie bars and swapping in pears for the apples. Feel free to leave out the caramel.",
Hi Sally and Team! Could this filling be used in a traditional pie as well? Thank you!,
Hi Alyssa! Here‚Äôs our full cherry pie recipe.,
"I was looking forward to making these bars, it was a very easy recipe to follow. The lemon juice and zest balanced this dessert as well as the almond extract, all perfect touches. My only complaint is these bars, in my opinion were missing some sweetness. Next time I make these I‚Äôll add a bit more cherries or maybe corn syrup to the pot.
Thank you for sharing!",4
Hi Sally! This recipe sounds amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to try it. Do you think this would fit well in a pie dish or 9 inch tart pan (so it‚Äôs more like a ‚Äúpie‚Äù bar for the holiday)? Thank you in advance!,
"Hi Veronica, there would be too much for a 9-inch pie dish or tart pan, but you could use a springform pan, which has taller sides. Hope this helps!",
Made this yesterday and everyone loved it! Perfect combination of sweet and tart. I will be making it again. Only tweak I would make is to add a little bit more melted butter in the crumble part as mine was a little dry.,5
"The recipe looks great and definitely one that I‚Äôll be making soon. That said, I do have two cans of sour cherrie ( not pie filling ) ‚Äî can they be substituted for the frozen? If not, not a problem. I‚Äôll just add frozen cherries to the grocery list. Love your blog and your recipes!",
"I do not recommend jarred cherries, as they will cook down into mush. It‚Äôs ideal to use frozen or fresh.",
"Do you think this recipe would work as individually cooked ‚Äúmuffins‚Äù? I was wanting something that would be easier to share at work/potentially less messy, so I was thinking of using a muffin pan and building the layers in each muffin spot.",
"Hi Robin, we haven‚Äôt tested this recipe that way, so are unsure how they would turn out, or what the bake time would be. If you try it, please report back!",
Can you make these in tiny 4‚Äù white pie plates.. so each person can eat with a fork ? What would be the cook time,5
"Hi Maria, we haven‚Äôt tested the recipe in small pie plates, so are unsure of what the bake time would be, or how many it would make. If you try it, keep a close eye on it while baking.",
"I made this with blueberries, soooooooo delicious!! Thank you",5
We loved these! Kiddo said favorite dessert yet‚Ä¶I could only find sweet cherries so will try to find tart cherries for the next batch!,5
Can you substitute fresh cranberries for the cherries?,
"Hi Eliza, here is our cranberry crumble pie bars recipe instead. Enjoy!",
Is it okay to use frozen tart dried cherries if I let them thaw? I was looking for a bar cookie to make them for Christmas . Thanks for all the great recipes.,5
"Hi Phyllis, you do not want to use dried cherries, even if they are frozen. They will not release liquid. Instead, you could thaw them and use them in these yummy shortbread wedge cookies.",
"Luckily, I had one frozen batch of sour cherries left (from the tree in my parents yard!) to make this awesome recipe with. It was delicious! Thank you!",5
It is very difficult to find sour cherries in California so I appreciate that you included the changes you should make to the recipe if you have to use sweet cherries.,
Would orange extract be a good substitute for the almond extract in the filling?,
"Hi Joanna, you can certainly give it a try!",
"I bought a frozen bag of cherries that are half sweet, half tart. Should I adjust the sugar at all? Thank you üôÇ",5
You may want to reduce the sugar by just 1 Tablespoon.,
"Hi
I completely missed adding the vanilla as I did not see it mentioned in the directions
At what point should I have done that?",
"Hi Shelley, see step 2 for adding the vanilla to the crust: ‚ÄúAdd the melted butter and vanilla, and stir until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand and no dry spots remain.‚Äù Yes, the baked and cooled bars freeze well for up to 3 months. You can freeze them with or without the icing. Hope you enjoyed them!",
"Thanks! Missed it even though I read through the recipe first.
Thumbs up even without the vanilla! My husband ate half I one sitting. Needless to say, baking another batch now and will freeze for the holiday",5
Would this work OK with gluten free flour? Would I need to add a binder to replace the gluten.,
"Hi Ella, since there isn‚Äôt *much* rising, and this is a denser-type bar, I believe these bars would work just fine with a GF flour blend replacement, like a cup-4-cup GF flour. I have not tested this though.",
I just wanted to update. I used rice flour and it turned out great!,
Have you tried this with blueberries?,
"Hi Judy, here is our similar recipe for blueberry pie bars instead.",
Often the name of the tart cherries is Montmorency cherries. Try looking with that name too. I also am going to try this with frozen raspberries. :p. So yummy!!,
"If you were making this vegan, what butter substitute would you use?",
"Hi Suz, I‚Äôm sure a vegan butter substitute would work nicely. I have not tested it though.",
"I see the adjustment for using sweet cherries but I would look to make it with your recommended sour, unfortunately I‚Äôve never been able to find them fresh or frozen.",
The crush ingredients calls for vanilla extract but the directions doesn‚Äôt include it.,
"Hi Kelsey, thanks for finding that. Add it with the melted butter.",
Are sour cherries a regional thing? I live in a major city in Texas and have never seen them. A quick online search of several different grocery stores turned up nothing.,
"Hi Samantha, it may be a regional thing. Did you try looking for ‚Äútart‚Äù cherries, too? You can try dark sweet cherries instead, see recipe note.",
"These look good. I have a quick question about the oats in the list of ingredients. Is it 85g PLUS 2 Tablespoons, or 85g is the total weight needed. It‚Äôs not 100% clear to me. I guess I have a second question. I have never seen frozen sour cherries anyplace. They are always sweet cherries. I know I can probably sub the sweet for the sour, but I‚Äôd like to use the correct ingredient. Where do you source your sour cherries?",
"Hi Ginny, I usually find sour cherries in the freezer section of grocery stores in the mid-Atlantic U.S. 85g is for 1 cup of oats, plus 11g for the 2 Tablespoons. Sorry for that confusion!",
