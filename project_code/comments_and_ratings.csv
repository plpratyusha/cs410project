"Dear Sally, so I too am a marylander and our small family also includes a rescue dog and like you was never a fan of cornbread. For thanksgiving I was asked to make cornbread. As I’d never made it before, although I do bake a bit of bread, I looked for a recipe and up came yours with the guarantee, best, soft, moist, buttery w/ a crispy crust so, while skeptical (that’s me) I gave it a try and Sally, not only do you not lie, not only was your statement not the least hyperbolic, but everyone at our Thanksgiving table (and we’re a critical bunch) raved about your cornbread. Thanks for helping to make my thanksgiving contribution a hit.",5
Can you double and bake in a 9 x 13 baking dish?,
"Hi Martha, yes, you can double this recipe for a 9×13 inch pan. I’m unsure of the exact bake time, but use a toothpick to check for doneness.",
This is a staple in our house. It’s delicious and everyone loves it!! I never used to make cornbread–maybe Jiffy from the box–but this comes together really easy and is a hundred times better. Now I make it all the time. I bake it up in my cast iron pan. We enjoy it fresh from the oven and then freeze whatever is left. Almost as good coming out of the freezer as it is fresh baked.,5
"I have tried many cornbread recipes over the years and I have to agree this is my favorite. It’s easy, very moist and delicious. Definitely a keeper. Serve it with honey butter and it will be a hit.",5
"I used polenta in this recipe, which gives it a slightly crunchy feel that I relly like. Great recipe.",5
"I had a hard time really telling if it was cooked all the way or not, and I’m not really sure what the texture is “supposed” to be like anyway so that part was slightly challenging but not because of the recipe haha. I also baked it in a slightly larger tray so I wasn’t sure of the timing. I baked it in a stoneware tray and it worked perfectly. It did not need to be buttered or floured and the edges got nice and golden. I used fine white cornmeal (usually used for making arepas) because it was what I had on hand.",5
How many people dose this feed,
"Hi Colin, this yields 9 servings, but feel free to cut the pieces larger/smaller.",
I would like to try this with leaving out the honey and using cream cheese for a creamier texture. Do you think it would work?,
"Hi Stephanie, we haven’t tested the recipe that way, so are unsure of the results. If you try it, let us know!",
I made the muffin version. I omitted the honey and added 4 oz of cream cheese. They have a real creamy texture and flavor. I think they taste wonderful!,
"I made this cornbread recipe and it was too sweet for me. Of course, that’s just me. Different tastes for different people. I love the opportunity to try new recipes and Sally’s Baking Addiction is my go to site for recipes of all kinds. Thank you.",
"Too sweet for me too
I will not put the sugar and honey next time Appart from this very good",
Hi can I use an 8in square pan? I know the bake time will be a little longer.,
"Hi Kelly, that will work! Correct, bake time will be a bit longer.",
The tin size seems wrong. The mixture makes a volume that comes up about 1cm in depth and has no sufficient rise in-bake (with such little baking soda). Disappointing,2
"Are you sure to use both baking powder and baking soda? It’s a considerable amount for so little flour. (Plus cornmeal.) The bake pan size is correct, and I find it rises quite nicely. I wonder if an ingredient was accidentally skipped?",
"Hi Ariana, you can double this recipe for a 9×13 inch pan. We’re unsure of the exact bake time, but use a toothpick to check for doneness.",
Love! BUT I am very very allergic to flour so I used Bob’s Red Mill gluten free corn bread mix and the all of your wet ingredients and your time and temperature and it’s perfect!!! My kids even love it!! Thank you!! Thank you!! I love your recipes!,5
"This is a huge favourite in our house with vegetarian chilli. I cook it for all my husbands mountain biking boys. Big pot of chilli, served with avocado and sour cream, and sally’s corn bread. We are in New Zealand, so not a common thing here, they all love it, I have to make two batches to ensure there is enough.",5
